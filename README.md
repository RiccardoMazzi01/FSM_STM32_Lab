# FSM_STM32_Lab
#### Semaphore Finite State Machine with the use of STM32 board.

- The "Automata_files" folder contains the files that you will need with a new IDE project.
In the folder there is also a "README.md" file with all the settings of the ".ioc" file and 
the istructions to move the files in the right folders of the project.

- The "automata_IDE_project" folder contains a full project with all the files ready to run on a board.

- The "images" folder contains the screenshots for the "README.md" file (ignore it).

The semaphore follows this FSM scheme:
